# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

The Depths of Rapture

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
I am going to make an interactive choose your own adventure game. However, this game will be based off the video game "Bioshock". This is one of, if not my favorite game I have ever played and I thought it would be cool to integrate that into my project.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
My project will put the user in the role of a person who stumbled upon the underwater world of Rapture. The player will be able to input their own name and gender so they can feel as if they are truly the character. The player will explore the city coming across various items, enemies, and other characters who may be there to help them or not. The software will have RPG elements to it with a certain weapon and plasmid capacity with a variety to choose from.

This project will be executed using many if-statements, functions, loops, and much more in order to create the best experience possible.
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
No matter what, I will accomplish a game that involves choices that puts the player in the city of Rapture.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
TODO
A better outcome will include images that appear within the game for certain portions in order to make the experience a better one. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
The best outcome I could have is a choice-based adventure game that includes many images and even movement for when the choices are made by the user throughout.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
In order to create the best possible project I can, I will need to brush up on and do some research on certain topics in Python. One aspect I want to look back on is with integrating images into my code. I do not remember everything with images and how to place them in the code, so I want to look back on that so I can put them into my project. I also wanna brush up on movement in Python so I can make the game as interactive and imersive as it can be.
